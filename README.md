## CS2030 Programming Methodology II

The notes were largely based off the actual notes provided during CS2030, which can be found here:

The link may be updated to cater to newer semesters.

## CS2040 Data Structures and Algorithms

My notes are essential summaries of the lecture slides. They do not include implementation details.

## CS2107 Introduction to Information Security

My notes were based on the slides and actual lectures attended. They used to contain the reading links from the slides but these were removed when I read through them.
